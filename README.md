# daily-kana
Simple command line program that randomly iterates through kana (currently only hiragana) to quiz the user.\
Requires MS Gothic or NSimSun fonts to be used within terminal in order to correctly display Japanese characters.\
The pairs in hiragana.txt were sourced from the relevant wikipedia pages matching a key of the kana to a list containing the romanization and pronunciation, formatted so that they can be easily imported into a dictionary using python's JSON library.
